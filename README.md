# Smart-Alarm-Clock
The smart alarm clock will wake users with the news, weather, LED lights, and of course sound. The project will use a Raspberry Pi 3, a touchscreen, and some sort of speakers. 

Welcome to the Smart-Alarm-Clock wiki!

Firstly, let me start off by saying I have never used GitHub... so please try to overlook my noobish rookie mistakes.

I will be starting this project within the next month or 2. My idea for the project is fairly straight forward, but I do predict some coding hiccups along the way - hence why I'm here xD. 

**MY VISION**

I am envisioning a small touchscreen device powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 (which I currently already own) that will allow a user to interact with a GUI to set certain perimeters such as if they want weather to read off or not, what time they want to get up, or what sound they want to wake up too. The music could be stored locally or on a network (but I'm not sure which would be better? HELP) Upon the alarm going off I would like a voice reader to audibly announce what perimeters the user selected. For example, "Good morning it is 6:00 AM, the current weather forecast for today will be sunny with a chance of rain in the afternoon, *news junk here*, have a great day!" *begins to play music file and maybe have a cool light show*. 

**What I need help with**
* I could really use some help with Raspberry Pi add on's and resources. I have experimented with mine a little, but not much. I just installed Retro Pi to play old SNES games! xD 
* Python programming and how to develop a simple GUI interface to display on the touch screen.
* This one is kind of silly but the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a power button. I could really use some ideas on how to maybe incorporate one, or should it just be on at all times? Not sure what is going to kick off the events, a time or the power turning on. Thoughts?
* Use of the I/O pins. Physically and coding wise. Such as how to activate each pin with a line of code.

I'm also thinking of incorporating some 3D prints as I am about to purchase a small 3D printer. Let your thoughts go wild. I'd love to hear what you think! I am open to any help for anything, whether it's navigating the site better or simple project improvement ideas!

Lastly, if anyone is still reading this, Thank you! I am excited about this project and getting to know the GitHub community! Cheers everyone!
